# so you decided to make a blog, now what?

well uhhh... umm.. uwaaaa <img src="https://akko.wtf/emoji/cinnamoncune/sgahri_shy.png" width="32px">

anyways, yes! welcome to the worst blog on planet earth! (i can't confirm nor deny expansion to other planets yet)

blogs are pretty cool - so i made one too. another one to add to the pile known as 'the internet',
which probably no one that's classified as a homo sapiens will read, however that's fine.
i intended to make this blog only for cats anyways. meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow

### what's there to even talk about, you fucking loser?

ME. I'M THE FUCKING BEST AND I NEED TO TELL EVERYONE. this will be a platform for
me to say <span style="color: #ff585b">[filtered]</span>
and also <span style="color: #ff585b">[filtered]</span>, and definitely
can't forget about <span style="color: #ff585b">[filtered]</span>. fucking <span style="color: #ff585b">[filtered]</span>.

## i'd like some QnA, do you mind?

nah, wsup g?

##### Q: ok, how much personality do you have?

> A: enough to put you 6ft under

##### Q: are you actually going to use this? for realsies?

> A: maybe. i can't predict the damn future headass. /lh

##### Q: is fedi not enough?

> A: usually it is, sometimes not really, and that's not because of character limits. at least it doesn't feel
> extremely appropriate to use fedi for long long posts - posts akin to this one.
>
> maybe there's a topic i want to rant about,
> so i'll just post here instead of cooking up something awkward on fedi. or i will make a video. :3

##### Q: what's your fedi?

>A: just [click here](https://akko.wtf/nvkomata) <3. you can follow me from your favorite mastodon / gt / akkoma / pleroma / misskey / sharkey / any other fedi instance.

### ...and now to test the delicious barf markdown is all about ðŸ¥´

fuck yeah! and it should be `github flavoured` too iirc. whatever that means, at least that's what's in the config lolololololol.

#### did you know?

this is the mascot of DeviantArt, "fella"! what a silly little fella.

*__fun fact__: if you go to the "ellen_joe" tag on DeviantArt, you will see an abundance
of art depicting Ellen Joe from ZZZ as pregnant or her feet in high detail. deviant art at it's finest.* ðŸ©·

### code block (BOOORINGGGGGG)

```css
/* here's a code block of some kind, with css inside.
why are you reading this? i just need to test the shiki highlighting

this is the rose pine theme, idk, it just looked nice */
body {
  background-image: url("hell.jxl");
  color: color-mix(in tears, var(--blood) 50%, darkness)
}
```
